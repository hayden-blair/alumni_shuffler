We live in a strange time, and are lucky to have technology that allows to stay connected while apart. Not only is it a tool, but this project is an example of two people in different states who have never met in person collaborating on a project together -- a project whose sole purpose is to help facilitate the virtual interaction of people from all over the country.  \n",
